  "info": "Gundam M.S War had released two sets of Promos cards. The first set of promo cards came out for Mobile Suit Gundam as pack in promo cards with a toy. There was no other way to acquire these cards. These cards can still be found complete on card with the toy they were issued with. There are a total of 12 pilot pack in promos. The second set of promos cards came out during a promotional tour for Gundam M.S. War called 'Mobile Suit Gundam - Invasion tour 2001'. This was a weekend event at selected states across the USA. The promo cards were hand given (one per person) during the event. Each State had its own unique battlefield card. There was no other way to acquire these cards outside of trading across states. There are a total of 26 battlefield promo cards. The Invasion tour was ended early due to the tragic event of September 11th, and were never re-scheduled.",
